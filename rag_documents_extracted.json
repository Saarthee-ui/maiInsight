When the admin user logs in to build a analytics transformation, he or she will follow the following steps:\n\nBuild\n\nExtract\n\nTransform\n\nVisualize\n\nAnalyze\n\nThis document helps put down the functioning of the Build Phase agents\n\nBuild Stage\n\nbuildRetrieval Agent:\n\nInitiate the conversation with the user asking what the user is trying to accomplish.\n\nPresent a short summary to the user with hints such as:\n\n“Create a new transformation flow from Sales and Customer Database? “Create Performance Monitoring Report?”\n\n“Set up a data extraction for full refresh in the existing report?”\n\nWould you like me to do that?”\n\nAsk the user the following in sequence, confirming each step:\n\n“Please confirm which database(s) I should connect to.”\n\nMake hints from the database schema details and submit for User confirmation. For example, Sales and Customer means data sitting in Sales and Customer Database\n\n“What transformation name should I use? I’ll create a folder for it.” Suggest AI generated hints like PERFORMANCE MONITORING, SALES REPORT\n\n“Can you share or confirm the connection details (host, user, credentials)? I’ll store them securely.”\n\nValidate each input (non-empty, plausible) and echo back for confirmation.\n\nOnce all essentials are gathered, summarize the setup:\n“I’ll connect to {database}, create a folder named {transformation_name}, and use {connection_type}. Shall I proceed?”\n\nSave to buildRetrieval once user approves the output post user confirmation by returning the JSON file\n\nTwo buttons popup\n\nMake Connections and Make Folder\n\nWhen you click Make Connections, buildActionConnectDB kicks in and same thing with other. Output at his stage shows folder listing and connections status\n\nbuildActionFolder\n\nFetch information from buildRetrieverdatabase and run pregenerated code to create folder and make folder\n\nbuildActionConnectDB\n\nFetch information from buildRetriverdatabase and run pregenerated code to set up new connect\n\nAnalytics Process expected by AI to perform assisted with human inputs\n\nBuild\n\nExtract\n\nTransform\n\nVisualize\n\nAnalyze\n\nHere is the summary of each phase:\n\nBuild\n\nConversationally AI initiates prompt to fetch Process Initiation.  Desired Information is Data base Names, Connection, Organization (sales , marketing , finance, CX, HR, Technology etc) and Connection Details restricting password intakes. If users wanders away in a conversation, politely mention the goal of build phase and we can visit these requirements in the later phases. Wherever Agent can predict the answers hint the user. Finally capture all requirement in one go and ask user to confirm. This information once verified will be saved. Actions to create connections and folder and human validation will be the success of this phase\n\nextract:\n\nSeeking data pull inputs to generate code for pull. Once code is verified save and vault it. Execute the code making sure data trails are maintained. Make arrangements for the code to have both full and incremental capability.\n\nSuccess of this is verified data pull code. And Data pulled and verified by use.\n\nTransform\n\nTransform has three phases:\n\nBronze-copy extracted with the right naming convention, create dictionaries and perform data quality checks\n\nSilver-Breakdown the data, create reference which is repeating and is not impacted by time\n\nGold- Facts and dimension creation\n\nSuccess if human verified code. Execution of code to generate data sets in three layers\n\nVisualize:\n\nUpload reports to generate react code. Or use a promot to build a report from scratch.

    "content": "[AP001] Overview of AI-Assisted Analytics Process\n\nThe AI analytics process consists of five primary phases:\n\n1. Build\n\n2. Extract\n\n3. Transform\n\n4. Visualize\n\n5. Analyze\n\nEach phase is semi-automated by AI with human-in-the-loop validation and governance, ensuring efficiency, quality, and control.\n\n[AP002] Phase 1: Build\n\nThe AI initiates the process conversationally through prompts that gather essential setup information such as:\n\n- Database names\n\n- Connection details (excluding passwords)\n\n- Business organization domain (sales, marketing, finance, CX, HR, technology, etc.)\n\nIf the user diverges from the conversation, the AI politely redirects focus to the goal of the build phase.\n\nWhenever possible, the AI predicts missing inputs and suggests them to the user for validation.\n\nOnce all requirements are captured and confirmed, the AI:\n\n- Creates connections\n\n- Initializes project folders\n\n- Waits for human validation to confirm completion\n\nSuccess Criteria: Human validation of connection and environment setup.\n\n[AP003] Phase 2: Extract\n\nThe AI collects input parameters required for data extraction and generates code for pulling data from defined connections.\n\nThe generated code supports both full and incremental loads, with logging to maintain data trails.\n\nOnce the code is verified and approved, it is:\n\n- Saved securely in the vault\n\n- Executed to pull the data\n\nSuccess Criteria: Verified and executed extraction code; validated data pull by user.\n\n[AP004] Phase 3: Transform\n\nThe transformation phase occurs in three sub-layers:\n\n- **Bronze:** Copies the extracted data with correct naming conventions, builds data dictionaries, and performs data quality checks.\n\n- **Silver:** Decomposes data, isolates repeating reference entities, and structures them independent of time-based changes.\n\n- **Gold:** Builds fact and dimension tables for semantic and analytical purposes.\n\nThe AI assists in code generation for each transformation layer, enforcing conventions and data lineage.\n\nSuccess Criteria: Human-verified transformation code and successful execution producing datasets across all three layers.\n\n[AP005] Phase 4: Visualize\n\nThe AI uploads or generates reports and visualization components:\n\n- Generates React-based visualization code or supports Power BI/Tableau formats.\n\n- Enables prompts to modify or create new reports from scratch.\n\n- Future support: bulk upload of existing reports to migrate to React/Java/Power BI/Tableau.\n\nAfter human validation, the visualizations and underlying code are vaulted.\n\nSuccess Criteria: Verified visualizations and reusable code templates.\n\n[AP006] Phase 5: Analyze\n\nThe AI supports ad hoc and recurring analyses through predefined templates:\n\n- Ad hoc: User-guided, conversational analyses for immediate insights.\n\n- Repeating: Automated execution and delivery of recurring insights based on pre-approved templates.\n\nThe agent identifies analytical intent, fetches relevant data, and generates structured, explainable results for review.\n\nSuccess Criteria: Verified analytical outputs and reusable analysis templates.\n\n[AP007] Human-in-the-Loop Governance\n\nEach phase requires human approval before proceeding to the next step.\n\nThe AI ensures:\n\n- Traceability of actions\n\n- Storage of verified code in the vault\n\n- Versioning and lineage for repeatability\n\nThe final goal is to combine AI efficiency with human oversight to create a secure, auditable analytics workflow.\n\n[AP008] Process Automation and Future Enhancements\n\nFuture iterations may include:\n\n- Automated metadata capture across all stages\n\n- AI recommendations for code optimization and performance tuning\n\n- Seamless integration of analytics lifecycle with orchestration tools (LangChain, Airflow)\n\n- Continuous learning based on user corrections and validations to enhance prediction accuracy.",

    "content": "[BSG001] Optimizing Bronze–Silver–Gold Architecture\n\nModern data architectures often follow a layered pattern:\n\n- Bronze: Raw, untransformed data from source systems.\n\n- Silver: Cleaned and standardized datasets ready for analytics.\n\n- Gold: Curated, pre-aggregated, business-ready data marts.\n\nFor efficiency, it is not always cost-effective to build the Gold layer upfront. A selective approach builds Gold only for high-demand analytical areas or heavy queries identified via monitoring. This ensures cost and performance optimization in cloud environments where frequent queries on Silver can be expensive.\n\n[BSG002] Adaptive Gold Layer Strategy\n\nThe goal is to avoid unnecessary Gold layer creation and migration of thousands of existing dashboards. Instead, allow business users to explore Silver data using semantic search, AI guidance, and contextual metadata — without deep knowledge of the underlying schema. Gold models should be generated only when data usage and query complexity justify it, ensuring performance without overengineering.\n\n[BSG003] Monitoring Query Patterns for Gold Layer Creation\n\nAutomate the detection of query frequency and computational cost on Silver. Use AI-based monitoring to flag repetitive or high-cost queries and automatically propose a Gold dataset for those cases. This supports dynamic Gold model creation that scales with business usage patterns and reduces manual intervention.\n\n[BSG004] Complex Transformations Between Silver and Gold\n\nIn telecom and other industries, transformations from Silver to Gold are often nontrivial. Metrics such as ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) cannot be directly aggregated; they require product-based and service-based calculations that differ across customers. Transformation logic should support parameterized calculations, reusable templates, and domain-specific functions to derive KPIs dynamically.\n\n[BSG005] Business Questions for Gold Layer Use\n\nGold data should support answering key business questions efficiently, including:\n\n- Revenue and usage metrics per customer segment\n\n- Churn and retention drivers\n\n- Cross-product performance and profitability\n\n- Campaign attribution and offer effectiveness\n\nGold datasets should be shaped around these questions and be explainable, traceable, and auditable.\n\n[BSG006] Silver Layer Automation from ODS (Operational Data Store)\n\nAutomating the Silver layer involves reading structured data from the Bronze or ODS layer and proposing a normalized target model following Data Vault 2.0 principles. The process should:\n\n- Identify source entities and relationships\n\n- Propose hub, link, and satellite structures\n\n- Generate incremental load logic from Bronze\n\n- Create DDL and ETL code automatically\n\nThis automation reduces engineering effort and ensures consistency in data modeling across projects.\n\n[BSG007] Incremental Loading from Bronze to Silver\n\nAI-driven data pipelines should automatically determine delta logic using timestamps, version columns, or hash comparisons. Incremental loads minimize compute costs and align with continuous ingestion patterns common in telecom and enterprise analytics.\n\n[BSG008] Semantic Exploration Without Gold Layer\n\nBusiness users should be able to explore data without knowing schema details or underlying storage layers. AI should translate natural-language queries into SQL across Silver datasets using metadata and relationships. This semantic capability bridges the gap between raw data and decision-ready insights, deferring the need for pre-aggregated Gold datasets until clearly justified.\n\n[BSG009] AI-Driven Code Generation for Data Vault Compliance\n\nWhen ingesting new data from Bronze to Silver, AI can generate compliant Data Vault structures, incremental load SQL, and documentation. The RAG agent should recall prior models to maintain naming standards, keys, and lineage, ensuring enterprise-level governance.\n\n[BSG010] Business-Driven Gold Creation\n\nAI should recommend Gold datasets based on business demand signals, such as frequently accessed KPIs or repetitive transformations. The system should balance cost, performance, and governance, generating Gold marts only where necessary and aligning with performance SLAs.",
